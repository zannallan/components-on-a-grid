## Hand in

### Submit the code

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit for grades using Markbot.

### Speak the answers

On GitHub’s website, on your forked repository, create an Issue labeled “Solution”—and tag your teacher.

**Record yourself speaking the final CSS—and upload/drop it into the GitHub Issue body.** (You’ll have to _zip_ the audio file before GitHub will allow you to drop it into an Issue.)

Here’s an example of what the recording would sound like (using different content).

<audio controls src="https://assets.learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/web-design-2/components-on-a-grid.mp3"></audio>

**Don’t forget to tag your teacher!**
